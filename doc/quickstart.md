# Re:VIEW Quick Start Guide

Re:VIEW is a toolset to convert from Re:VIEW format documents into various formats.

Re:VIEW uses original lightweight markup language like EWB, RD or Wiki.  Its syntax is simple but powerful for writing IT documents.
When you write your documents in Re:VIEW format, you can convert them with Re:VIEW tools into LaTeX, HTML, EPUB, InDesign, Text, and so on.

Re:VIEW is free software under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License Version 2.1, so you can use, modify and redistribute it. This license has no relations with your documents using Re:VIEW, so your documents are not forced to use this license. When you want to distribute Re:VIEW software itself or the system including Re:VIEW software, you should read COPYING file carefully.

This article describes how to setup Re:VIEW and use it.

The supported version of the article is Re:VIEW 3.0.

## Set up Re:VIEW

Re:VIEW is a software in Ruby and worked in Linux/Unix, macOS, and Windows. You can install Re:VIEW with RubyGems or Git.

Note that Re:VIEW format is plain texts with simple markups in UTF-8, so you can write it on any editors and OSes.

### using RubyGems

Re:VIEW is released as RubyGems.

* https://rubygems.org/gems/review

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```Gemfile
gem 'review'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install review
```

### using Git

You can get latest Re:VIEW sources from GitHub.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kmuto/review.git
```

You can use Re:VIEW to add `review/bin` directory to `$PATH` variable.

You can update the sources as follows:

```bash
$ git pull
```

## Writing Re:VIEW Document

### Generating template fiels

After setup, you can use `review-init` command to generate Re:VIEW project directory.

To generate `hello` project:

```bash
$ review-init hello
$ cd hello
$ ls hello
Rakefile     catalog.yml  config.yml   hello.re     images/      layouts/     sty/         style.css
```

In `hello` directory, many files are generated.

* `*.re` : Re:VIEW format file.
* config.yml : configuration file
* catalog.yml : catalog file (for TOC)
* Rakefile : rule file for `rake` command
* images : folder for images
* layouts : forlder for layout files
* style.css : sample stylesheet
* sty : style files for LaTeX
* doc : various documents (including this document)
* lib : detailed rule files of rake command and etc.

### writing Re:VIEW documents and converting them

```review
= My First Re:VIEW

//lead{
"Hello, Re:VIEW."
//}

== What's Re:VIEW

@<b>{Re:VIEW} is a converter from simple markup documents into various formats.

You can generate documents as follows:

 * text with tagging
 * LaTeX
 * HTML
 * XML

You can install Re:VIEW with:

 1. RubyGems
 2. Git
 3. Download from GitHub

The web site of Re:VIEW is @<tt>{https://reviewml.org/}.
```

You should use UTF-8 as encodings in text files.

### generating PDF, EPUB, and plain-text

You can generate a PDF file with `review-pdfmaker` command.  Also you can generate an EPUB file with `review-epubmaker` command, and can generate an plain-text file with 'review-textmaker' command.

To generate PDF, you should install TeXLive 2012 or later.  To generate EPUB, you should install zip command.
When you want to use MathML, you should install [MathML library](http://www.hinet.mydns.jp/?mathml.rb)

Each maker need `config.yml`, configuration YAML files.  `review-init` command generates `config.yml` in default.

```bash
$ review-pdfmaker config.yml     ## generate PDF
$ review-epubmaker config.yml    ## generate EPUB
$ review-textmaker config.yml    ## generate text with decoration
$ review-textmaker -n config.yml ## generate text without decoration
```

You also can generate them with Rake.

```bash
$ rake pdf       ## generate PDF
$ rake epub      ## generate EPUB
$ rake text      ## generate text with decoration
$ rake plaintext ## generate text without decoration
```

There is a sample YAML file [config.yml.sample](https://github.com/kmuto/review/blob/master/doc/config.yml.sample) in the same directory of this document.

### add chapters and modify them

`catalog.yml` file is a catalog of Re:VIEW format files.

If you create new `*.re` files as new chapters, you should add the name of files into `catalog.yml`.

```bash
$ cat catalog.yml
PREDEF:

CHAPS:
  - first-chapter.re
  - second-chapter.re

APPENDIX:

POSTDEF:
```

The first item in CHAPS is the first chapter, and the second item (if you add) is the second chapter. PREDEF is for front matter, APPENDIX is for appendix, and POSTDEF is for back matter.  You can see in detail with [catalog.md](https://github.com/kmuto/review/blob/master/doc/catalog.ja.md).


### more information

For more information about Re:VIEW format, see [format.md](https://github.com/kmuto/review/blob/master/doc/format.md).

## convert file by file

You can convert a *.re file with `review-compile` command.

When you want to convert sample.re, you can do as belows:

```bash
$ review-compile --target text sample.re > sample.txt    ## for text
$ review-compile --target html sample.re > sample.html   ## for HTML
$ review-compile --target latex sample.re > sample.tex   ## for LaTeX
$ review-compile --target idgxml sample.re > sample.xml  ## for XML
$ review-compile --target markdown sample.re > sample.md ## for Markdown
```

`review-compile` and other commands in Re:VIEW has `--help` option to output help.  `review-compile` has many options, so you may see them.

## preprocessor and other commands

With Re:VIEW tags such as `#@mapfile`, `#@maprange` and `#@mapoutput`, you can include content of files or result of command execution. To do so, you use `review-preproc` command.

```bash
$ review-preproc hello_orig.re > hello.re   ## redirect stdout into file

## also:
$ review-preproc --replace hello.re   ## update files overwriting
```

You can use `review-vol` command to know the volume of the document.

```bash
$ review-vol
```

You can also use `review-index` command to generate header list.

```bash
$ review-index --level <heading level> -a
```

## how to update the document folder to the new Re:VIEW version

Re:VIEW is updated regularly. We Re:VIEW team watch the backward compatibility carefully, but if you want to use the features in the new version, you can use review-update command to update the document folder.

```bash
$ review-update
** review-update updates your project to 3.0.0 **
