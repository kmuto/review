ReVIEW is a easy-to-use digital publishing system for books and ebooks.

== Format

ReVIEW uses its original format('ReVIEW format') as source files. See doc/format.rdoc (in Japanese).

Output formats ReVIEW supports are:

* EPUB
* LaTeX(ptexlive)
* InDesign(IDGXML)
* plain text(TOPBuilder Markup Lang.)
* Inao(gihyo.jp original markup)

== Commands

There are two commands generate files directly.

* review-epubmaker: generate EPUB file.
* review-pdfmaker: generate PDF file using LaTeX(ptexlive).

And some useful commands.

* review-compile: compile ReVIEW fomat files.
* review-vol: figure out size of ReVIEW files.
* review-index: generate index with various format.
* review-preproc: preprocessor.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
